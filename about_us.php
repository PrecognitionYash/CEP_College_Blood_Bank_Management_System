            <h2 class="text-secondary">Survey on Blood Bank Management System</h2>
            <p>Our team recently conducted a survey at Hedgewar Hospital to gather insights into the effectiveness of their Blood Bank Management System. The survey involved interactions with healthcare professionals, blood donors, and staff members to evaluate several key aspects of their operations. The survey focused on the following areas:</p>
            <ul class="list-group mb-4">
                <li class="list-group-item">User experience of the blood donation process</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Efficiency in blood inventory management</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Timeliness of blood distribution</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Satisfaction with communication between donors and blood banks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The survey results showed an overall positive response, with participants noting improvements in the donor experience and blood supply management. These insights are valuable for understanding the strengths and areas for growth in the current system.</p>
